# 🎮 Metal Slug Replica (C++ & Raylib)

A modern take on the classic **Metal Slug** arcade game — a side-scrolling, run-and-gun shooter built entirely in **C++** using **Raylib**. This project follows a modular architecture, separating gameplay components like enemies, bullets, player controls, and game states into maintainable C++ classes.
